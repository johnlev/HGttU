# Hitchhiker's Guide Bot

> John Kotz

It's me!! This digital book is your guide to hitchhiking through the cosmos. Of course, you have a number of options for books and enciclopedias to help you through your universal adventure, but you chose this one. Or maybe you didn't cause you were pulled off your home planet only to find it is destroyed seconds after your forced departure. Either way, you're using me right now, aren't you? What more do you need? Fine. The hitchiker's guide to the galaxy is the primo, #1 guide to hitchhiking through the cosmos. There are a couple other options out there, but not one of them can compare to us in accuracy, precision, or, most importantly, fun.

This is a Slack bot that provides information stored in the Hitchhiker's Guide an attempts to write some of it's own entries.

## Setup
Follow these instructions to setup the local environment to run this bot.

1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/johnlev/HGttU.git slackbot` in Terminal
2. Enter the direcotory: `cd slackbot`
3. Put the .env file into this directory
4. Install homebrew: `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
5. Install node: `brew install node`
6. Install packages: `npm install`
7. Run it `npm run dev`

Now you should be able to talk to the universe_guide_dev app just like the real one, but local changes will be noticable. So go ahead, edit code and responses as you wish.
